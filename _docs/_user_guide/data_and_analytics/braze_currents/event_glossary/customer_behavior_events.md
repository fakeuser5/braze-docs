Please contact your Braze representative or [open a support ticket][support] if you need access to additional event entitlements. If you can't find what you need below, check out our [Message Engagement Events Library]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/message_engagement_events/) or our [Currents sample data examples](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples/tree/master/sample-data).

{% details Explanation of Customer Behavior Event Structure %}
<br>
This Customer Behavior Events breakdown shows what type of information is generally included in a customer behavior event. With a solid understanding of its components, your developers and business intelligence strategy team can use the incoming currents event data to make data-driven reports, charts and take advantage of other valuable data metrics. 

![image]({% image_buster /assets/img/customer_engagement_event.png %})

Customer Behavior Events events are comprised of __user specific__ properties, __behavior specific__ properties and __device specific__ properties. 

{% enddetails %}

{% alert important %}
Please note that these schemas __only apply to the flat file event data we send to Data Warehouse partners (Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage)__. For schema that apply to the other partners, please check [their respective pages]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/available_partners/).

{% alert tip %}
We do track other News Feed events; these are located in [Message Engagement Events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/message_engagement_events/).

## Uninstall Events

{% apitags %}
Uninstall
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when a user uninstalls an app. Use this data to track when users uninstall an app.

{% alert important %}
Please note that this is not fired when the user actually uninstalls the app - that's impossible to track exactly. Braze sends a daily silent push to determine if the app still exists on your user's device, and if we get an error on that silent push, it is assumed the app has been uninstalled.
{% endalert %}

```json
// Uninstall Event: users.behaviors.Uninstall
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (string) braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,
  "time": (int) time of the event in seconds since the epoch,
  "app_id": (string) id for the app on which the user action occurred
}
```

{% endapi %}

{% api %}

## Attribution Events

{% apitags %}
Attribution
{% endapitags %}

This event occurs when an app installation is attributed to a source. Use this to track where your app installs are coming from.

```json
// Install Attribution Event: users.behaviors.InstallAttribution
{
  "id": (string) unique id of this event,
  "user_id": (string) braze user id of the user,
  "external_user_id": (string) External ID of the user,
  "time": (int) time of the event in seconds since the epoch,
  "source": (string) the source of the attribution
}
```
